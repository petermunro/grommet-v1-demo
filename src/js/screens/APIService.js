      Raised on hip-hop and foster care, defiant city kid Ricky gets a fresh
      start in the New Zealand countryside. He quickly finds himself at home
      with his new foster family: the loving Aunt Bella, the cantankerous Uncle
      Hec, and dog Tupac. When a tragedy strikes that threatens to ship Ricky to
      another home, both he and Hec go on the run in the bush. As a national
      manhunt ensues, the newly branded outlaws must face their options: go out
      in a blaze of glory or overcome their differences and survive as a family.
